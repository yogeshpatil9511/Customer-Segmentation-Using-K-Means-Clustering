# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

Segmented over 2,240 customers into six actionable groups by leveraging K-Means clustering, feature engineering, and interactive visualization. Deployable Streamlit app enables real-time predictions for business users.

***

## 📌 Project Highlights

- Identified 6 unique customer segments from a dataset of 2,240 records and 29 features.
- Engineered features including Age, Total_Spending, and Customer_Tenure for sharper insights.
- Achieved optimal segment separation using StandardScaler, Elbow Method (K=6), and PCA.
- Delivered a Streamlit web app for instant customer profiling by non-technical users.
- Actionable findings: Premium and Digital customers spend most; Dormant and Budget types need re-engagement.
- All code modular, production-ready, and easily extendable for future analytics.

## 🚦 Steps & Workflow

- **Data Cleaning:** Removed 24 missing rows (<1%), ensuring robust preprocessing.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created relevant features to drive model accuracy and interpretability.
- **Exploratory Analysis:** Visualized age, income, spending, and response rates; spotted strong income-spending correlations.
- **Modeling:** 
  - Scaled data (StandardScaler)
  - Determined cluster count (Elbow: K=6)
  - Fitted K-Means; validated clusters via PCA plots
- **Evaluation:** 
  - Confirmed cluster cohesion (Silhouette scoring, PCA separation)
  - Analyzed group patterns and business impact
- **Deployment:** Streamlit interface for real-time segment prediction; ready for production.

## 🔬 How We Evaluated

- Monitored inertia and silhouette scores for cluster validation.
- Checked business alignment of segments with EDA and pivot tables.
- Used PCA: 2 components explained 78% of feature variance.
- Ensured reproducibility by saving model & scaler with Joblib.


## 📊 Sample Results

- Segment sizes:  (Premium, Digital, Budget, Occasional, Store-loyal, Dormant)
- Key Insights: PhD customers spend 40% more; divorced customers accept 22% more campaigns
